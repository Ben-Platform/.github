# Ben Platform 
## Ben is a platform built to support the 🥬 KALE ecosystem on Stellar. 

### The platform consists of several components, which include: 
- An Android mobile app, named _Ben Wallet_.
- A WebApp, to provide account information and details view on account transactions and account stats, named _MyBen_ hosted on https://myben.xyz. 
- An RPC server that handles blockchain interaction as well as Relayer (currently, Open Zeppelin relayer) interactions, named _BEN RPC_.
- A monitoring and reporting server to provide timeseries information on the platform's status, as well as consolidated stats, named _Ben OpenStats_.
- An offload-compute server, for part of the farming cycle, so devices can offload compute-intensive tasks, named _Remote Grow_.
- A Kotlin SDK for Android mobile apps, to support building Stellar-based apps on mobile devices.

## Learn
We'll also share public repos focused on:
- Showing how to develop your own apps on Stellar, including how to use the JS SDK (user-facing apps) and how to do Authorization, among others.
- The lifecyle of core KALE apps.
- Moving your dev mindset and skills to a 100% Functional-oriented paradigm.
- Learning about Deno, Deno Deploy, Typescript (get ready for tsgo!), Kotlin Arrow and Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Documentation
We host *live* documentation on Gitbook (which means we update daily), with in-depth information not just on each of these components but also on our entire development cycle.
